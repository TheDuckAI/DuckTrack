3. Make sure the "Display" is set to your main display, and you should see your screen on the canvas. Select "Ok." _(in MacOS if your screen is black with a red square in the top left try to disable then re-enable OBS Screen Recording permissions, this has worked before)_

1. Now you can close OBS and OBS will opened and controlled automatically when you launch the Computer Tracker App. Also, the Computer Tracker app creates a new OBS profile so you don't have to worry about your previous settings being messed up.
